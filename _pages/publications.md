### Competing with the Platform: Complementor Positioning and Cross-Platform Response to Entry
  * Accepted at Strategic Management Journal (forthcoming)
  * Presented at SMS, AOM, DRUID, and BU Platform Conferences.
  * with Prof. Aldona Kapacinskaite (Bocconi)

**Abstract:** 

  
This study examines complementor response to competition with the platform owner. We account for the existence of complementors’ outside option of repositioning to a competing  platform, and we argue that generalists experience low repositioning cost and are more likely  to shift effort to a competing platform, while specialists focus on the focal platform. We  examine Apple’s “Files” app entry and find support for our hypotheses. Contrasting Apple’s entry with that of other non-platform large firms, we find that only the platform owner elicits  a strong complementor response, highlighting unique characteristics of platform owner as  competitor. This paper contributes to the competitive and corporate strategy literatures, underscoring how complementor heterogeneity affects cross-platform allocation of effort when the platform owner becomes a competitor in complementor spaces.
