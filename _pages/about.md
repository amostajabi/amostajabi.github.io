I am an Assistant Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). My main research interest is studying the innovation and competition dynamics broadly, with a particular interest in platform strategy. In my research, I study how platformsâ€™ adoption of different governance policies can heterogeneously impact the behavior of users and firms. I obtained my PhD from London Business School in Strategy and Entrepreneurship in 2025.

My research has been recognized by different bodies, including the Academy of Management TIM Division and the Institute of Entrepreneurship and Private Capital (IEPC) at London Business School. I have also been serving as the social media coordinator of AOM's TIM Division since 2024.

Prior to joining academia, I worked as a Senior Product Manager at Snapp!, the largest ride-hailing platform in the middle-east. I also have experience in managing technical teams and advising startups in accelerators and incubators regarding their strategy and business model development.
