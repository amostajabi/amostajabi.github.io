My name is Ahmadreza Mostajabi. I am a PhD student in the Strategy and Entrepreneurship department at London Business School. My main research interest is studying the innovation and competition dynamics in platform businesses. In my research, I study how platformsâ€™ enactment of different governance policies can heterogeneously impact the behavior of users and firms. Prior to joining academia, I worked as a Senior Product Manager at Snapp!, the largest ride-hailing platform in the middle-east. I also have experience in software development as well as advising startups in accelerators and incubators regarding their strategy and business model development.
