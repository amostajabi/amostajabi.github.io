I am an incoming (2025) Assistant Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), currently completing my Ph.D. at [London Business School](london.edu). My main research interest is studying the innovation and competition dynamics broadly, with a particular interest in platform strategy. In my research, I study how platformsâ€™ adoption of different governance policies can heterogeneously impact the behavior of users and firms. Prior to joining academia, I worked as a Senior Product Manager at Snapp!, the largest ride-hailing platform in the middle-east. I also have experience in software development as well as advising startups in accelerators and incubators regarding their strategy and business model development.
