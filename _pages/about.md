My name is Ahmadreza Mostajabi. I am a PhD student in the Strategy and Entrepreneurship department at London Business School. My main research interest is studying the innovation and competition dynamics in platform businesses. In my research, I study how platforms’ enactment of different governance policies can heterogeneously impact the behavior of users and firms. Prior to joining academia, I worked as a Senior Product Manager at Snapp!, the largest ride-hailing platform in the middle-east. I also has experience in software development as well as advising startups across accelerators and incubators regarding their strategy and business model development. I also co-founded his own, an instant messaging platform, in 2016.
