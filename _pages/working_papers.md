### The double-edged sword of resolving market friction in platform markets
  * with Prof. Keyvan Vakili (LBS) and Prof. Aldona Kapacinskaite (Bocconi)

**Abstract:** 

  
Platform owners try to resolve frictions that complementors face for value creation, including those associated with their access to additional markets, by lowering their cost of expansion. Extant literature is relatively silent regarding the potential impact of complementors’ market knowledge on their performance. We argue that complementors’ knowledge of the market to which they expand not only determines their within-market performance but their overall performance as well. We study this in the context of mobile-app platforms by analyzing the effect of applications’ roll-out expansion to additional markets. We find that complementors, on average, perform much better in markets they have more knowledge about. Moreover, this effect is heterogeneous across different market categories. While the effect is negligible for generic complements, market knowledge strongly impacts the performance of context-specific applications. We also find complementors that expand to markets in which they have low market knowledge hurt their overall performance in addition to that of the expanded market. Our findings imply that platform owners’ friction resolution can be a double-edged sword: while facilitating complementors’ access to additional markets provides expanded access to both complementors and users, it can have negative spillover effects on complementors’ performance in their existing markets.
